  Code Shape Website
</h1>

This is a live production build of Code Shape website connected to Netlify as the host. It's created using React as library and Gatsby as framework. Additionally the build is using TypeScript with styled-components provide direct CSS properties per components. 

Below you will find more information on how to get started as contributor.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone Site using GitHub Desktop or your favorite command line tool.**

    Use the command line tool to clone the repository: 

    ```shell
    # git clone https://github.com/Code-Shape/code-shape-website/
    ```
    
    Navigate into the project's directory and install node modules: 
    
    ```shell
    # cd code-shape-website
    npm install
    ```
    

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up. (Skip cd command if you are already in the directory)

    ```shell
    cd code-shape-website
    gatsby develop
    ```
    
     **Start Testing**
     
     If you need to test how Netlify builds the site, you would need to start the production build. Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up. (Skip cd command if you are already in the directory)
      
      ```shell
    cd code-shape-website
    gatsby build && gatsby serve
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The development site will run at `http://localhost:8000`
    
    Testing build site will run at `http://localhost:9000`

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._


## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
